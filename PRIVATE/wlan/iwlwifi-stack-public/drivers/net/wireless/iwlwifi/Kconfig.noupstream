config IWLXVT
	tristate "Enable XVT op_mode"
	depends on m
	select IWLWIFI_DEVICE_TESTMODE
	select IWLWIFI_SUPPORT_DEBUG_OVERRIDES
	help
	  This option enables the xVT operation mode. xVT mode supports
	  special debug and testing operations that are not supported in
	  the standard operation modes, and is used for verification
	  purposes.
	  xVT mode does not support the standard WiFi operations, and
	  does not communicate with the user mode through the nl80211.

	  Enabling this options allows to fully control the HW using
	  an external tool in user space.

	  Say Y if you have the user space application and want
	  to execute debug and testing flows on the HW.

	  2 - Balanced Power Save (BPS): the default mode.

	  This value might get overridden by power_scheme module_param if exists.

	  Enable this option if your base kernel has broken PCI(e)
	  suspend/resume code and the driver has to work around it
	  or if you need the driver to store and restore the PCIe
	  configuration for other reasons.

	  Enable this option if for some reason you cannot rely on
	  the kernel calling the wiphy's suspend/resume function at
	  the right place. Don't enable this unless you need it.

	  Enable this option if for some reason you require the
	  device to pretend it's in RF-kill while suspended. This
	  should normally not be necessary.

	  Note that selecting this option will disable WoWLAN and
	  actually remove the feature completely.

	  the WiFi component is idle.

	  This option enables (vendor) events to userspace and traffic
	  monitoring for low-latency and traffic thresholds, as well as
	  their impact on quota and other submodules.
