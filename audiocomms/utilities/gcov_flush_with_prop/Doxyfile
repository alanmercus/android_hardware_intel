# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project


# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then Doxygen
# will interpret the first line (until the first dot) of a JavaDoc-style
# comment as the brief description. If set to NO, the JavaDoc
# comments will behave just like regular Qt-style comments
# (thus requiring an explicit @brief command for a brief description.)

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = YES


# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available.
# Private class members and static file members will be hidden unless
# the EXTRACT_PRIVATE and EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES

EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = YES


# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will
# generate Latex output.

GENERATE_LATEX         = NO
